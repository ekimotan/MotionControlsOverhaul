# Motion Controls Overhaul (Bannerlord Mod)

Motion Controls overhaul is a mod for Mount and Blade 2 Bannerlord. Leveraging Transpiler's of Harmony library it lets players to control their camera using their Dualshock 4 or Dualsense controller's gyro. Mod has been released on [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3428989632)!

## What's in the future?

By freeing the right stick from the camera it's possible to try out a new combat system. Currently I am developing a combat control system that would feel more immersive.

Have fun!
